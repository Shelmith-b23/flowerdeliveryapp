# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Code Splitting
## Google Maps API Key

This app loads the Google Maps JavaScript API to support live delivery tracking.
Add a `.env` in the `frontend/` folder (copy `.env.example`) with your browser key:

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and set REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY to your key
```

Important: The Maps API key is visible to browsers — set restrictions in Google Cloud (HTTP referrers) to limit usage.
If you see the console warning "InvalidKey", the API key is incorrect or not enabled for the Maps JavaScript API. To fix:

1) In the Google Cloud Console, go to APIs & Services -> Credentials -> Create credentials -> API key.
2) Enable the Maps JavaScript API: APIs & Services -> Library -> Maps JavaScript API -> Enable.
3) Edit the key, and add application restrictions (HTTP referrers) with `http://localhost:3000/*` for local development.
4) Update `frontend/.env` with the key and restart the dev server:
```
REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=YOUR_ACTUAL_KEY
npm start
```

If your backend runs on a different port (for example `5001`), set the API base URL so the frontend talks to the right backend:

```bash
# in frontend/.env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5001/api
```

Then restart the frontend dev server.

This resolves the "InvalidKey" warning in the browser console and avoids the key being used from untrusted domains.
